# Discipline Tribute Page

A minimalist web project built for the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). This tribute page honors the principle of **discipline** — the quiet, consistent force that shapes men into who they’re called to be.

## 🧠 What is Discipline?

> "We should discipline ourselves in small things, and from these progress to things of greater value."  
> — *Marcus Aurelius*

Discipline is choosing growth over ease. Every time.  
It’s doing what must be done, especially when you don’t feel like it.  
Discipline is love — the kind that corrects, refines, and strengthens.  
It’s training the body, mind, and spirit to submit to truth.  
It’s a sacred rebellion against everything that tries to make you soft.

## 🔥 Why It Matters

Discipline matters because without it, nothing real lasts.  
Talent fades. Feelings lie. Motivation dies.  
But discipline keeps you moving forward when everything else wants to pull you back.  
It’s not about being perfect — it’s about being **consistent**, **focused**, and **unshakable**.

Discipline is how you train yourself to choose long-term purpose over short-term pleasure.  
It’s how you rise — no matter how slow, no matter how hard.

## ✍️ Discipline in My Life

Discipline is how I stay aligned — in mind, body, spirit, and craft.  
It’s waking up to seek God before the world gets loud.  
It’s training when I’m tired, creating when no one’s watching, choosing truth over ease.  
Discipline shows up in what I eat, how I move, how I pray, and what I build.  
It’s not about hype — it’s about consistency. Obedience. Inner fire.  
One hard choice at a time.

## 🏆 The Rewards of Discipline

Discipline gives you what motivation never can — **real results**.  
- Strength that lasts  
- Clarity in chaos  
- A mind that doesn’t fold when life hits  
- Confidence rooted in consistency

It doesn’t just build habits — it builds character.  
And in time, you realize: the pain of discipline was never pain at all — it was purpose carving you into something **unshakable**.

## ⚔️ Final Words: A Call to Action

> “To those who hear the voice of the harder path: walk it.  
> You’re not alone.  
> **Discipline is the weapon. Purpose is the war.**”
